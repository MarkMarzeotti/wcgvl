# WordCamp Greenville 2020

## Getting started with Gutenberg blocks

The idea behind this talk is to give everyone a way to incorporate the block editor into their development routine. This particular repo will focus on using Advanced Custom Fields and PHP to build blocks as opposed to React and Javascript. The result is a very ACF/traditional WordPress looking form that can be used as a block in the block editor alongside standard content. This essentially replaces the need for the Flexible Content field when creating flexible and dynamic layouts using WordPress and ACF.

If you are looking for information on building traditional blocks using React and Javascript, check out my full tutorial with examples in my [Building Gutenberg Blocks repo](https://github.com/MarkMarzeotti/building-gutenberg-blocks).
